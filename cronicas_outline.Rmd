##Project outline

Cronicas is a study of household air pollution and clinical outcomes which was conducted in Lima and Puno, Peru in 2014-2015. 

48 hour direct-reading measurements of PM2.5 and CO at one minute temporal resolution were taken in roughly 800 households in Lima (urban) and 800 households in Puno (rural) who used traditional, biomass stoves for cooking.

###Research question
How do levels of PM2.5 and CO compare among houses who use traditional cookstoves between urban and rural areas of Peru?

###Steps:

1. Process 1600 raw data files into tidy datasets
2. Create summary measures of pollutant levels over time
3. Conduct analysis comparing pollution across geographic locations

###Bonus:
* Merge CO and PM data by household ID, explore correlation between contaminant levels and differences in this correlation by geography (possible reasons for variation could be urban vs. rural house construction, weather differences, etc)
* Create a package to clean, graph, and analyse PdR(PM) and CO(Lascar) raw data 

###Goals for the next week
1. Process raw data into tidy datasets
2. Explore whether there are existing R packages that process data from these instruments

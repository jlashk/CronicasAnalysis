##Project outline

Cronicas is a study of household air pollution and clinical outcomes in Lima and Puno, Peru in 2014-2015. 

48 hour direct-reading measurements of PM2.5 and CO at one minute temporal resolution were taken in roughly 800 households in Lima (urban) and 800 households in Puno (rural) who used traditional, biomass stoves for cooking.

###Research question
How do levels of PM2.5 and CO compare among houses who use traditional cookstoves between urban and rural areas of Peru?

###Steps:

1. Process 1600 raw data files into tidy datasets
2. Create summary measures of pollutant levels over time
3. Conduct analysis comparing baseline pollution across geographic locations

###Progress this week
* Cleaned files names by extracting info from file names using regular expressions and transforming to standardized format (household ID, contaminant, device ID, sample date)

###Goals for the next week
* Read files, look for missing/weird data, begin to create summary statistics
